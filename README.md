## Hi there, it's Patricia! ðŸ‘‹

[Adalaber promo B](https://adalab.es/)

I'm a passionate Frontend Developer with a love for creating beautiful and responsive web experiences. I thrive with building modern, responsive websites. Currently looking to collaborate on projects that focus on frontend technologies, although also learning and intrested in backend projects. Curious mind. I love learning something new every day, and that's what fuels me as a rookie developer.
   
### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about
  Anything related to Frontend development (React, JavaScript, SCSS, etc.), responsive design and how to make websites look great on any screen size.
